# Service Performance Monitoring (SPM) with Jaeger of your Own Service/Application

![](images/jaeger04.png)

*By Robert Baumgartner, Red Hat Austria, February 2023 (OpenShift 4.12)*
*By Robert Baumgartner, Red Hat Austria, October 2023 (OpenShift 4.13)*

In this blog I will guide you on how to use service performance monitoring (spm) with jaeger.
It should work with any appliaction that is working with OpenTelemetry.

This document is based on OpenShift 4.13. See [Distributed tracing release notes](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/distr_tracing/distr_tracing_rn/distr-tracing-rn-2-9.html).

OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator is based on Jaeger 1.47.0

OpenShift distributed tracing data collection Operator based on OpenTelemetry 0.81.0

## OpenTelemetry and Jaeger

**OpenTelemetry** is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.

**Jaeger** is a tool to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems.

In the the following diagram I will show you how the flow will be between your application, OpenTelemetry and Jaeger.

![Flow](images/OpenTelemetryCollector.png)

To make the demo simpler I am using the AllInOne  image from Jaeger. This will install collector, query and Jaeger UI in a single pod, using in-memory storage by default.

More details can be found

- [OpenTelemetry Reference Architecture](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/)
- [Jaeger Components](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.47/architecture/#components)

## Enabling Distributed Tracing

A cluster administrator has to enable the Distributed Tracing Platform and Distributed Tracing Data Collection operator once. 

As of OpenShift 4.13, this is be done easily done by using the OperatorHub on the OpenShift console. See [Installing the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/distr_tracing/distr_tracing_jaeger/distr-tracing-jaeger-installing.html).

![operatorhub.png](images/operatorhub.png)

In this demo we do not install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator, because we use only in-memory tracing - no persistence.

Make sure you are logged in as cluster-admin!

After a short time, you can check that the operator pods were created and running and the CRDs are created:

```shell
$ oc get pod -n openshift-distributed-tracing|grep jaeger
jaeger-operator-bc65549bd-hch9v                              1/1     Running   0             10d
$ oc get pod -n openshift-opentelemetry-operator
opentelemetry-operator-controller-manager-69f7f56598-nsr5h   2/2     Running   0             10d
$ oc get crd jaegers.jaegertracing.io
NAME                       CREATED AT
jaegers.jaegertracing.io   2021-12-08T15:51:29Z
$ oc get crd opentelemetrycollectors.opentelemetry.io
NAME                                       CREATED AT
opentelemetrycollectors.opentelemetry.io   2021-12-15T07:57:38Z
```

## Enabling Monitoring of Your Own Services in OpenShift 4.6+

Using the montoring for user-defined projects in OpenShift saves us to deploy our own Prometheus instance.

In OpenShift version 4.6+ monitoring for user-defined projects is GA. See [Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.html)

As of OpenShift 4.6+, this is done by an update on the configmap within the project openshift-monitoring.

Make sure you are logged in as cluster-admin:

```shell
$ cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true
    thanosQuerier:
      enableRequestLogging: true    
EOF
```

## Check User Workload Monitoring

After a short time, you can check that the prometheus-user-workload pods were created and running:

```shell
$ oc get pod -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring 
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prometheus-operator-7bcc9cc899-p8cbr   1/1     Running   0          10h
prometheus-user-workload-0             5/5     Running   1          10h
prometheus-user-workload-1             5/5     Running   1          10h
thanos-ruler-user-workload-0           3/3     Running   0          10h
thanos-ruler-user-workload-1           3/3     Running   0          10h
```

## Create a New Project

Create a new project (for example jaeger-demo) and give a normal user (such as developer) admin rights onto the project:

```shell
$ oc new-project jaeger-demo
Now using project "jaeger-demo" on server "https://api.yourserver:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
$ oc policy add-role-to-user admin developer -n jaeger-demo 
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/admin added: "developer"
$ oc policy add-role-to-user monitoring-edit developer -n jaeger-demo 
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/monitoring-edit added: "developer"
```

## Login as the Normal User

```shell
$ oc login -u developer
Authentication required for https://api.yourserver:6443 (openshift)
Username: developer
Password: 
Login successful.

You have one project on this server: "jaeger-demo"

Using project "jaeger-demo".

$ NAMESPACE=`oc project -q`
```

## Create Jaeger

Create a simple Jaeger instance with the name my-jaeger and add some environment variables to the deployment.

```shell
$ cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: my-jaeger
spec:
  allInOne:
    # image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.31
    metricsStorage:
      type: prometheus
    options:
      # log-level: debug
      prometheus:
        query:
          # namespace for thanos-querier
          support-spanmetrics-connector: true
        server-url: "https://thanos-querier.openshift-monitoring.svc:9092"
        tls.ca: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt
        tls.enabled: "true"
        token-file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
    metricsStorage:
      type: prometheus
  strategy: allinone
EOF
jaeger.jaegertracing.io/my-jaeger created
```

When the Jaeger instance is up and running you can check the service and route.

```
$ oc get svc
NAME                           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                  AGE

$ oc get route my-jaeger -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
my-jaeger-jaeger-demo.apps.rbaumgar.demo.net
```

Open a new browser window and go to the route url and login with your OpenShift login (developer).

## Create OpenTelemetry Collector

Create configmap and an OpenTelemetry Collector instance with the name my-otelcol.

The configmap is used because the Jaeger service requires encryption. These certificates are issued as TLS web server certificates. More details can be found at [Understanding service serving certificates](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/security/certificates/service-serving-certificate.html)

```shell
$ cat <<EOF |oc apply -f -

      port: 8889
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8889
EOF

```

When the OpenTelemetryCollector instance is up and running you can check log.

```shell
$ oc logs deployment/my-otelcol-collector

```

Very important is the last line ("State of connection...") which shows that the collector is connected to the Jaeger instance.
If this is not the case, you have to update the spec.config.exports.jaeger.endpoint value in your OpenTelemetry Collector instance. Should be <jaeger-collector-headless>.<jaeger-namespace>.svc:14250.

Can be done by:

```shell
$ oc edit opentelemetrycollector my-otelcol
```

You can check that the Prometheus port is available at port 8889.

```shell
$ oc get svc -l app.kubernetes.io/name=my-otelcol-collector
NAME                            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                                    AGE
my-otelcol-collector            ClusterIP   172.30.131.109   <none>        8889/TCP,14278/TCP,4317/TCP,4318/TCP,55681/TCP,65535/TCP   4d2h
my-otelcol-collector-headless   ClusterIP   None             <none>        8889/TCP,14278/TCP,4317/TCP,4318/TCP,55681/TCP,65535/TCP   4d2h
```

## Setting up Metrics Collection

To use the metrics exposed by OpenTelemetry Collector, you need to configure OpenShift Monitoring to scrape metrics from the */metrics* endpoint. You can do this using a ServiceMonitor, a custom resource definition (CRD) that specifies how a service should be monitored, or a PodMonitor, a CRD that specifies how a pod should be monitored. The former requires a Service object, while the latter does not, allowing Prometheus to directly scrape metrics from the metrics endpoint exposed by a pod.

```shell
$ cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    k8s-app: otelcol-monitor
  name: otelcol-monitor
spec:
  endpoints:
    - interval: 30s
      path: /metrics
      port: metrics
      scheme: http
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: my-otelcol-collector
EOF
servicemonitor.monitoring.coreos.com/otelcol-monitor created
$ oc get servicemonitor
NAME                   AGE
otelcol-monitor   42s
```

:star: The *matchLabels* must be the same as it is defined at monitoring service of The OpenTelemetry Collector!

## Sample Application

You can use any application which is using OpenTelemetry. You have to make sure that your application is sending the OpenTelemetry data to http://my-otelcol-collector:4317!

If you have no application, continue and deploy the sample application. Otherwise go to the next chapter.

### Deploy a Sample Application

All modern application development frameworks (like Quarkus) supports OpenTelemetry features, [Quarkus - USING OPENTELEMETRY](https://quarkus.io/guides/opentelemetry).

To simplify this document, I am using an existing example. The application is based on an example at [GitHub - rbaumgar/otelcol-demo-app: Quarkus demo app to show OpenTelemetry with Jaeger](https://github.com/rbaumgar/otelcol-demo-app). 

Deploying a sample application monitor-demo-app end expose a route:

```shell
$ cat <<EOF |oc apply -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: otelcol-demo-app
  name: otelcol-demo-app

          image: quay.io/rbaumgar/otelcol-demo-app-jvm
          env:
            - name: OTELCOL_SERVER
              value: 'http://my-otelcol-collector:4317'

  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  labels:
    app: otelcol-demo-app
  name: otelcol-demo-app
spec:
  path: /
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: otelcol-demo-app
  port:
    targetPort: web
  tls:
    termination: edge    
EOF

$ oc set env deployment/otelcol-demo-app SERVICE_NAME=https://`oc get route otelcol-demo-app -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'`
deployment.apps/otelcol-demo-app updated
```

The environment variable with the name OTELCOL_SERVER specified to point to the right OpenTelemetry Collector: (http://my-otelcol-collector:4317)

### Test Sample Application

Check the router url with */hello* and see the hello message with the pod name. Do this multiple times.

```shell
$ export URL=https://$(oc get route otelcol-demo-app -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
$ curl $URL/hello
hello 
$ curl $URL/sayHello/demo1
hello: demo1
$ curl $URL/sayRemote/demo2
hello: demo2 from http://otelcol-demo-app-jaeger-demo.apps.rbaumgar.demo.net/
...
```

Go to Jaeger URL.
Reload by pressing F5.
Under Service select my-service. 
Find Traces...

![Jaeger Find](images/jaeger02.png)

:star: The service name is specified in the application.properties (quarkus.application.name) of the demo app.
:star: The url of the collector is specified in the application.properties (quarkus.opentelemetry.tracer.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://my-otelcol-collector:4317).

Open one trace entry and expand it to get all the details.

![Jaeger Result](images/jaeger03.png)

Done!

If you want more details on how the OpenTracing is done in Quarkus go to the Github example at [GitHub - rbaumgar/otelcol-demo-app: Quarkus demo app to show OpenTelemetry with Jaeger](https://github.com/rbaumgar/otelcol-demo-app). 

## Accessing the Metrics of Your Service

Once you have enabled monitoring your own services, deployed a service, and set up metrics collection for it, you can access the metrics of the service as a cluster administrator, as a developer, or as a user with view permissions for the project.

To access the metrics as a developer or a user with permissions, go to the OpenShift Container Platform web console, switch to the Developer Perspective, then click **Observer â†’ Metrics**.

:star: Developers can only use the Developer Perspective. They can only query metrics from a single project.

Use the "Custom query" (PromQL) interface to run queries for your services.
Enter "duration" and ENTER you will get a list of all available values...

Following metric names will be created:

Type: counter

Description: counts the total number of spans, including error spans. Call counts are differentiated from errors via the status_code label. Errors are identified as any time series with the label status_code = "STATUS_CODE_ERROR".

- calls

Type: histogram

Description: a histogram of span latencies. Under the hood, Prometheus histograms will create a number of time series:

- duration_count: The total number of data points across all buckets in the histogram.
- duration_sum: The sum of all data point values.
- duration_bucket: A collection of n time series (where n is the number of latency buckets) for each latency bucket identified by an le (less than or equal to) label. The latency_bucket counter with lowest le and le >= span latency will be incremented for each span.

Here is an example

![Observe](images/observe01.png)

Some more examples: 
- duration_sum{job="my-otelcol-collector",span_name="/hello"}
- sum(rate(calls{service_name =~ "my-service", span_kind =~ "SPAN_KIND_SERVER"}[10m])) by (service_name)

You can also use the **Thanos Querier** to display the application metrics. The Thanos Querier enables aggregating and, optionally, deduplicating cluster and user workload metrics under a single, multi-tenant interface.

Thanos Querier can be reached at: https://thanos-querier-openshift-monitoring.apps.your.cluster/graph

If you are just interested in exposing application metrics to the dashboard, you can stop here.

## Workaround

When you want to use the Thanos-Querier in the OpenShift User Workload Monitoring you have to make some additional changes to get access to the Prometheus data of your project.

- you have to present a authentication bearer to get access.
- you need to add "namespace=" as query parameter. The bearer has to have at least view rights on the namespace.

The newly SPM feature of Jaeger does not provide paramaters to set those requirements.
Two feature enhancment are created
[spm additional query parameter required for prometheus](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/4219)
[spm bearer token required for prometheus](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/4219)
So I decided to create a nginx reverse proxy with this feature.

Deploy the nginx:

```shell
$ NAMESPACE=`oc project -q`
$ BEARER=`oc whoami -t`
$ sed "s/<BEARER>/$BEARER/g" nginx/configmap.yaml | sed "s/<NAMESPACE>/$NAMESPACE/g" | oc apply -f -
configmap/nginx created
$ oc apply -f nginx/deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/nginx created
$ oc apply -f nginx/service.yaml
service/nginx created
```

Check that the nxinx pod is up and running

```shell
$ oc get pod -l app=nginx
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-76545df445-fj48l   1/1     Running   0          82m
```

At the end we configure Jaeger to use the proxy as Prometheus endpoint.

```shell
$ oc patch jaeger/my-jaeger --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace","path": "/spec/allInOne/options/prometheus/server-url", "value":  "http://nginx:9092"}]' 
jaeger.jaegertracing.io/my-jaeger patched
```

## Show Service Performance Monitoring (SPM)

If you have not created some test data now is the right time...

Go to your Jaeger UI, select the Monitor tab, and select the right service (my-service)

![SPM at work](images/jaeger04.png)

Done!


## Remove this Demo
